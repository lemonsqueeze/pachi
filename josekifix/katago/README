[ KataGo Setup ]

Example KataGo setup to use as external joseki engine.

This is intended for Raspberry Pi (cpu build), so using small network and few visits.
Desktop can use 15 block model and more playouts, especially with AVX support.
Feel free to experiment with other networks / settings.

- Models:

  Models are from the [extended training](https://github.com/lightvector/KataGo/blob/master/TrainingHistory.md) run:
  They are small models which have been trained beyond their normal scope,
  they do very well for their size (much better than other models of similar size).
  
  10 block model:  [g170e-b10c128-s1141046784-d204142634.bin.gz](https://katagoarchive.org/g170/neuralnets/g170e-b10c128-s1141046784-d204142634.bin.gz)
  15 block model:  [g170e-b15c192-s1672170752-d466197061.bin.gz](https://katagoarchive.org/g170/neuralnets/g170e-b15c192-s1672170752-d466197061.bin.gz)
    
- Config:

  Options you might want to change are numSearchThreads (number of search threads) (not
  automatically set to your number of cpu cores) and maxPlayouts for thinking time.
